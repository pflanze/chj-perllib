=head1 NAME

Chj::noTEST

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Chj::noTEST;
 TEST { foo } "bar"; # will be ignored / garbage collected right away

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Disable TEST forms within a package, so that they don't take up memory
or clutter your test output. (Note that you can always restrict which
packages to run tests on by giving arguments to run_tests, though. But
they *will* take up some memory even when never used, hence
Chj::noTEST.)
